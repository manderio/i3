# i3 - nvim edition
My i3 config that I am making as vim like as possible, with a gruvbox theme of course!

Got a few things to do, so will have to edit this a bit more. Here's a short to-do list:
- Look through config to make sure to add more vim shortcuts
- Clean up and categorize config to be smaller
- Make sure switching between left and right workspace works (yes, really)

Lets hope I get this done before switching to xmonad -.-"
